NAME
    Module::Install::ReadmeFromPod - A Module::Install extension to
    automatically convert POD to a README

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      author 'Vestan Pants';
      license 'perl';
      readme_from 'lib/Some/Module.pm';

    A "README" file will be generated from the POD of the indicated module
    file.

    Note that the author will need to make sure
    "Module::Install::ReadmeFromPod" is installed before running the
    "Makefile.PL". (The extension will be bundled into the user-side
    distribution).

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::ReadmeFromPod is a Module::Install extension that
    generates a "README" file automatically from an indicated file
    containing POD, whenever the author runs "Makefile.PL".

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "readme_from"
        Does nothing on the user-side. On the author-side it will generate a
        "README" file using Pod::Text from the POD in the file passed as a
        parameter.

          readme_from 'lib/Some/Module.pm';

        If a second parameter is set to a true value then the "README" will
        be removed at "make distclean".

          readme_from 'lib/Some/Module.pm' => 'clean';
